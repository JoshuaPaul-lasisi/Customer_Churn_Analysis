**Future Work**
The following are some suggestions for future work:

Analyze the reasons for churn in more detail. For example, you could look at the reasons for churn by customer segment or by churn time.
Develop a churn prediction model. This model could be used to identify customers who are at risk of churning and to target them with retention campaigns.
Implement the findings from this analysis to create targeted retention campaigns.
